                <p>BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with 
                    group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping.[11] BTS was originally supposed to 
                    be a hip hop group similar to YG Entertainment's 1TYM,[12] but between their initial formation 
                    and their debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided instead to create an idol group similar to Seo Taiji 
                    and Boys who were popular in the 90's. A group able to make socially conscious music without
                     the restrictions K-pop bands were known for, able to be sincere and genuine at a time where 
                     K-pop bands were highly regimented.

                <p>On June 12, 2013, BTS released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, the first installment 
                    of their "school trilogy" series, simultaneously with its lead single "No More Dream", which 
                    quickly fell off the charts.[18][19] The album, however, reached the top five in South Korea 
                    on the Gaon Music Chart.[20] Their subsequent single "We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2" failed to 
                    chart.</p>

                    O!RUL8,2?, along with its single "N.O,".[25] Despite several performances on Korean music shows, 
                    the single quickly fell off the charts</p>
